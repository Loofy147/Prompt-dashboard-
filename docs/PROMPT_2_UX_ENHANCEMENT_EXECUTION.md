## 2. Lead UX Designer Analysis

### Evaluation of `PromptEditor.tsx` and `QualityCalculator.tsx`

**Current Problem 1: High Cognitive Load in Improvement Selection**
Users have to manually click "BOLT TIP" to get advice. The advice appears in a small box that is easily missed. There is no clear "Path to 0.90" presented to the user.
- **Proposed Solution**: Implement an **Auto-Insight Banner**. If Q < 0.85, automatically display the most impactful dimension improvement suggestion.
- **Success Metric**: Reduce time-to-first-edit by 30%.

**Current Problem 2: Abstract Dimensional Breakdown**
Linear progress bars are good for individual scores but bad for understanding the "shape" of a prompt's quality. It's hard to visualize the balance between Persona (P) and Context (R).
- **Proposed Solution**: Integrate a **PES Radar Chart** using Recharts. This provides a professional "signature" for each prompt and makes imbalances immediately obvious.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Use `bg-palette-light/50 backdrop-blur-md` for the chart container.
- **Success Metric**: 100% of testers prefer radar view over linear bars for balance analysis.

**Current Problem 3: Friction in Iterative Saving**
Professional engineers iterate 50+ times per hour. Requiring a mouse click for every save version breaks "flow state".
- **Proposed Solution**: Implement **Global Keyboard Shortcuts**. `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows) should trigger the primary "Save Version" action. Add a "Save & Continue" option to stay in the editor.
- **Success Metric**: Reduce clicks-per-hour by 40% for power users.

## 3. Implementation Specification

### QualityCalculator.tsx Changes
- **New Component**: `PESRadarChart` inside the calculator.
- **Visuals**: Use `#6366f1` (Indigo) for the area and `#fbbf24` (Amber) for the grid.

### PromptEditor.tsx Changes
- **Keydown Listener**: `useEffect` with `(e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) && e.key === 'Enter'`.
- **UI Element**: Add a "Version Path" breadcrumb (e.g., `#102 > #145 > #current`) at the top of the editor.
